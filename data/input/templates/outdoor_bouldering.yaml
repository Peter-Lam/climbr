  # Enter a grade, it can be format you want as long as you are consistent (V Scale, Font, Dankyu, ungraded ...)
  # This template shows range between two grades since that's how Altitude grades problems, however this can be changed for your gym
  # ---- Terminology ----
  # Onsight - Completing a problem on your first try - without beta from others (typically not used indoors, so you can remove this section if you want)
  # Flash - Completing a problem on your first try, beta from others is allowed
  # Redpoint - Completing a problem for the first time but with multiple attempts (ie. Finishing V3/V4 after 5 attempts)
  # Attempts - Trying a problem

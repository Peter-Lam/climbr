  More focus on the Quarry again. Nancy and I went to Coyote Rock Gym to buy liquid chalk from them ($20 for 500ml). The chalk is super liquidy but does the job.
  Mini-projected a kid V4/V5 problem this session.

    notes:
      I got the step-up start really quickly but struggled with match my feet on the small foot hold on the volume. I felt that my tarantulas lacked 
      sensitivity which meant I couldn't confidently switch my feet. Also, since this was my first dyno problem after coming back to the gym, I had messed
      up 3 attempts with the dyno once I got past the foot matching crux. Since I was able to do it in one session, my goal now is to see if I can affectively redo 
      the problem in the future. I want to also try with my Scarpa Instincts VS to see if the shoes would help me.

    notes:
      Two more attempts today, first one I missed the dyno and second one I used Nancy's static beta to get past that move. With the second attempt,
      I got to the mantle but lost balance as I started to extend out of the mantle and push myself up.

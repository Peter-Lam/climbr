  Full session today so it was a little busier than normal. The Chow family were also climbing today.
  Felt pretty accomplished today, since I sent a V5/V6 Kids on the second go and got a V3/4 pinch adult on the first go of the day (with 1 attempt last session)

    notes:
      Pretty proud of a redpointing a V5/V/6 on the second try. The igloo/brick hold were intimidating since I remember not being able to grip them on slab.
      After watching Austin and Nancy attempt it last session, and hearing that the angle wasn't bad, I really wanted to try the problem. Also I'm surprised that I was
      able to read the beta for the last move, and realized that I could move my hips close to the wall with a good down-turn heel hook.

    notes:
      After thinking about the beta from last session, decided that going for the left hold would result in my arms being too extended for the next dynamic 
      right hold so I avoided ti this time and it worked out well. Pinches weren't super great but good to practice on since I don't do them often

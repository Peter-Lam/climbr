  Quick evening climb. I still felt sore from the last indoor session so decided to mostly scout climbs, document, and spot.
  Went and checked out Gateway, Nine-Tenths, and Frigid Cave

      Mostly wanted to try at least one problem.
      Next time, should move feet and flag right instead of left

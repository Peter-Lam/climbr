    notes:
      Messing around with different beta. Watch Daniel do it and he puts his
      left leg under him to shift his weight. I need to commit to the move more if 
      I want to finish it.

    notes:
      The starting is really hard to statically climb, so Roy had a good
      beta to skip the intermediate hold and dynamically move for the shelf/ last
      hold instead.

    notes:
      Felt much more comfortable on this problem now that I know which holds are good. It's becoming a good warmup

    notes:
      Reverse of Radioactive that Nancy has been doing. Felt easier than Radioactive so I'm giving it a VB. I've usually have been doing this 
      problem on the way back from the down climb.

    notes:
      Top=out was not as good as the first time. Very sloppy but my technique on the start was better.

      Really easy. Didn't have much trouble other than feeling that the holds weren't super secure.

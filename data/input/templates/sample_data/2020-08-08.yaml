    notes:
      Didn't look too bad at first glance since a lot of the holds were jugs. The last 3 pockets holds are not great so I think the crux will be around there.
      After watching Roy go first, Brandon and I decided to skip the first pocket, but I might have to find a different beta because skipping will require a big move that
      is at my mac arm-span

    notes:
      Not a hard problem but I felt really scared with the starting foot hold because it's soo small. I need to work on using my toe more because I think I;ve been struggling with
      small foot holds ever since coming back.

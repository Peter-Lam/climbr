    notes:
      Got my hands in the pocket for the first time. I was very controlled, so I should have just committed to grabbing the hold. I didn't think I would make it 
      so I just fell.

    notes:
      This climb was harder than it looked. The top half was hard for me to stick compared to Nancy. I think I need to move my feet lower because of my height to avoid moving away form the wall
      when moving to the right crimpy hold.

  Daniel's first day back. It was super busy today so it was really hard to project and try the new problems. Saw a V5/V6 in the quarry that looked flash-able but
  I got a cramp on my attempts.

    notes:
      For sure it's flash able but I got a cramp on the second move so I couldn't finish it.
      I should be able to get it my next attempt but I'm still bummed I didn't flash it

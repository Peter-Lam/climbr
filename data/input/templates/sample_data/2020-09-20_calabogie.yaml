      I felt way more comfortable this time. Strength and footwork was pretty good and I didn't spend too much time finding my feet

    notes:
      Pulling hard on the start was a little hard for me. The sit starts are pretty tough since that's not a move I practice much indoors. My foot slipped on the second last hold but was able top recover from it.

    notes:
      I found it difficult to start using Frank's beta so I went with a heel hook around the corner.
      This works for a static left hand move to the crimp but leaves me too far to the right, making it hard
      to switch feet and move the the left side pull.

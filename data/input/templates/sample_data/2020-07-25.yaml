    attempts: 3
    notes:
      Made three attempts on this problem. First going for a left mantle, second for a right mantle and the third just missed the dynamic third move.
      The first attempt the the best since the mantle isn't as high, the second attempt was harder because I don't think I enough enough strength to mantle in that position.
      I need to continue to work on mantles so I think I'll be projecting this and repeating it many times before it gets reset.

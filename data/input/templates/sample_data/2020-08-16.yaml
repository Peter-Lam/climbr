  Double session today. I thought my hands would be in bad shape from climbing yesterday,
  but it held up pretty well. I got my first V5/V6 post COVID shutdown, and got closer on the
  white comp problem. I got to the last hold but slipped.

    notes:
      My first repeat on this problem. I used Brandon's beta and shifted my weight to the right
      when switching feet and that helped me control my movements more.

    notes:
      Quick attempt on this but my hands hurt too much to try again. I went for a static
      beta that I saw on instagram and it might work well if my hands are recovered. I will have to try this beta
      again next time.

    notes:
      Completed my first V5/V6 post shutdown on my second attempt of the day. I tried a couple more times
      afterwards to try to get it on video but no success. I think I was just getting tired and sloppy
      since it was at the very end of the session.

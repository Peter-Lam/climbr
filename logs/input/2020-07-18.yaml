  Re-opening day since Altitude closed because of COVID-19. We went as soon a it opened and was a full house.
  I found that the easier problems had pretty non-juggy holds so they were a little difficult and scary to do.
  Notably, before the shutdown, I was flashing almost all V3/V4's and projecting V5/V6 but now I'm struggling to do even 1 V3/V4.

    notes:
      Fun coordination problem. Ran up and down a lot until I realized that bending my legs instead of 
      standing straight up allowed me to get under the starting holds better

      # ---- Terminology ----
      # Onsight - Completing a problem on your first try - without beta from others (typically not used indoors, so you can remove this section if you want)
      # Flash - Completing a problem on your first try, beta from others is allowed
      # Redpoint - Completing a problem for the first time but with multiple attempts (ie. Finishing V3/V4 after 5 attempts)
      # Attempts - Trying a problem
